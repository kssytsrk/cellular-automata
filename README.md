This project emulates a cellular automata environment using the [lispbuilder-sdl](https://github.com/lispbuilder/lispbuilder) graphics library. Rulesets currently implemented are all of the 1D ones, any 2-states Neumann/Moore neighbourhood ones (if you can find the exact ruleset number, that is) and Game of Life. 

This will be updated as I read more papers on cellular automata and improve my understanding of it.

A better README file is in progress, too.
